MAT <- INPUT matrix

FOR i <- 1 TO n
	FOR j <- 1 TO n
		INPUT element at position MAT[i][ j]

To add two matrices;

// A and B are existing matrices, C is the matrix of A + B
MATRIX-ADDITION (A, B)
FOR i <- 1 TO n
	FOR j <- 1 TO n
		C[I][j] <- A[i][j] + B[i][j]
return C

To multiply two matrices;

// A and B are existing matrices, C is the matrix of A * B
MATRIX_MULTIPLICATION (A, B)
	IF LENGTH(A) = LENGTH(B[i])
		FOR i <- 1 TO n
	ELSE
		return FALSE
